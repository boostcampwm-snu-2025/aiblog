This PR focuses on implementing user post management features, incorporating feedback, and refactoring the codebase using Context and Reducer.\n\n**What changed:**\n\n*   **Feedback Incorporation:**  The PR addresses various pieces of feedback, including improvements to exception handling and consolidating the `title` and `content` states.\n*   **MyPostPage Implementation:**  A new `MyPostPage` feature was added, enabling users to:\n    *   View their saved blog posts.\n    *   Edit existing posts.\n    *   Delete posts.\n*   **Refactoring:**  The core logic for managing blog posts was refactored to utilize Context and Reducer. This facilitates global state management of articles stored in `localStorage`.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\n*   **Enhanced User Experience:** The `MyPostPage` significantly improves the user experience by giving users direct control over their saved content.  They can now easily manage, modify, and delete their blog posts, increasing engagement and usability.\n*   **Improved Code Structure:** The refactoring using Context and Reducer provides a more maintainable and scalable architecture.  By centralizing state management, the application becomes easier to reason about and debug.  Changes to the state are now more predictable and less prone to unexpected side effects.\n*   **Demonstrates Learning and Adaptation:** The author's notes on \"Gomin-gwa HaeGyeol Gwajeong\" (Concerns and Resolution Process) are particularly valuable. The reflection on when to use caching (ReactQuery, SWR) for LLM-driven content generation and the challenges of LLM-assisted refactoring highlight the importance of critical thinking when leveraging AI tools.\n*   **Consistency and Best Practices:** Addressing the feedback ensures a higher quality codebase adhering to best practices regarding error handling and state management. Combining title and content into a single state simplifies data handling.\n\n**Key Takeaways/Points of Discussion:**\n\n*   **Caching for LLM Interactions:** The author considered caching mechanisms (ReactQuery, SWR) to optimize LLM interaction, specifically for scenarios with repeated requests. This illustrates a thoughtful approach to resource management and performance optimization.\n*   **Refactoring Challenges with AI:** The PR highlights the challenges of using LLMs for complex refactoring tasks. The author observed that LLM-generated code often resulted in excessive custom hooks and prop drilling, suggesting the need for careful guidance and manual adjustments when using AI for code restructuring. The author raises an important question regarding the criteria for effective refactoring.\n*   **AI Usage:** The author reports utilizing AI in all stages of development. While not explicitly detailed, this implies a reliance on AI tools for coding assistance, debugging, and possibly code review.\n\nThis PR represents a significant step forward in the development of the smart blog, introducing important user features and improving the underlying architecture.  The author's reflections on the development process and the use of AI provide valuable insights for the team. Further discussion should focus on establishing clear refactoring guidelines and exploring strategies for more effectively utilizing AI in code refactoring tasks.\n",
