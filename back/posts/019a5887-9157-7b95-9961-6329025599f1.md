# Optimizing PostgreSQL Query Performance: A Practical Guide

## Why Query Performance Matters

Slow database queries are often the hidden bottleneck in web applications. Users don't see the code—they see response times. A 500ms query delay becomes a frustrated user.

## Understanding EXPLAIN ANALYZE

The first step to optimization is understanding what's happening. PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command is your best friend:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.id, u.username, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id;
```

This reveals execution plans, sequential scans vs. index scans, and where time is actually spent.

## Common Optimization Strategies

**Index on Foreign Keys:** Always index columns used in JOIN conditions. This converts sequential scans to index scans.

**Partitioning Large Tables:** Tables with millions of rows benefit from range or hash partitioning, improving query speed and maintenance operations.

**Materialized Views:** For expensive aggregations accessed frequently, consider caching results in materialized views refreshed on a schedule.

## Benchmarking Changes

Never assume an optimization works. Always benchmark:

```sql
-- Before optimization
\timing on
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table WHERE indexed_column = 'value';
\timing off
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating too many indexes (slows writes)
- Not analyzing query plans before optimizing
- Premature optimization on small datasets
- Ignoring connection pooling

## Conclusion

Database optimization is iterative. Monitor your slow query logs, profile with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, implement targeted changes, and measure the impact. Small improvements compound into significant performance gains.
