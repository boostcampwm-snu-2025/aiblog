# Building Performant Cross-Platform Apps with Rust and React Native

**Published:** November 6, 2025 | **Reading time:** 8 min | **Tags:** rust, mobile, cross-platform

## Introduction

Cross-platform development has become increasingly popular, but performance often takes a hit when using traditional JavaScript-based approaches. In this post, we'll explore how combining Rust with React Native can give you the best of both worlds: rapid development cycles and native-level performance.

## The Problem with Pure JavaScript

While React Native offers excellent developer experience, computationally heavy operations can cause frame drops on low-end devices. This is where Rust shines.

## Enter UniFFI

UniFFI provides a clean Foreign Function Interface for calling Rust code from your mobile applications. Here's a basic example:

```rust
pub fn compute_expensive_task(input: String) -> String {
    // Your performance-critical logic here
    format!("Processed: {}", input)
}
```

## Integration Workflow

1. Write performance-critical code in Rust
2. Expose via UniFFI bindings
3. Import bindings in your React Native application
4. Call native functions from JavaScript

## Real-World Results

Projects using this approach have reported 40-60% performance improvements in data processing tasks compared to pure JavaScript implementations.

## Conclusion

The Rust + React Native combination isn't a silver bullet, but it's a powerful tool for teams that need both development speed and runtime performance.
